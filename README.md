## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The task of analyzing and determining veracity of social media content has been of recent interest to the field of natural language processing. After initial work, increasingly advanced systems have been developed to support the analysis of rumour and misinformation in text. Stance classification is considered to be an important step towards rumour verification, therefore performing well in this task is expected to be useful in debunking false rumours. This project comes up with a solution for the ‚ÄúRumourEval‚Äù task given by the SemEval forum. It deals with stance classification of the tweets, then further classifying them as rumour or not rumour followed by prediction of the veracity of the rumours. 
- This project proposes a Graph Conditional Random Field based sequential model to handle the conversational structure of tweets, which achieves an accuracy of 74% on the RumourEval dataset. 
- It also proposes a stacked LSTM neural network model to predict the veracity of a rumour , which achieves an accuracy of 85% on the RumourEval dataset. 
- Going one step ahead, this project also provides evidence to substantiate the claim by using a Deep Siamese Bi-LSTM neural network model which acheives an accuracy of 87% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset.

## Architecture of the project <a name="architecture"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dataset which is given in the form of nested folders is converted into json objects. Every tweet in the object undergoes preprocessing to make it fit for evaluation. The focus then shifts to the content of the tweet leading to feature extraction. The features extracted are fed into a Graph CRF model for classification into Support, Deny, Query or Comment. This classification further acts as an aid in predicting the veracity of the tweet. An LSTM model is used to classify the tweet into Rumour or not a rumour. Finally, the tweet is tweaked to make it suitable for internet search. A siamese network model is built with the help of the search results and provides information that acts as proof to support the claim made by the LSTM model.

## Modules <a name="modules"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This section contains detailed explanation of all the 4 modules.    


   ### SDQC Classification <a name="sdqc"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SDQC Classification can be seen as a sequential classification problem which analyses the relationship between different tweets in a tree structure and outputs whether the tweet is in Support, Denial, Query or Commenting with respective to the root tweet. This project proposes a *Graph Conditional Random Field* model which considers the full conversation tree structure. Conditional Random Field (CRF) is a sequence modeling algorithm which not only assumes that the features are dependent on each other, but also considers the future observations while learning a pattern. This combines the best of both HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and MEMM (MaxEnt Markov Model). In terms of performance, it is considered to be the best method for sequential classification.

Graph CRF is a probabilistic graphical model in which a graph denotes the conditional independence structure between random variables:      
*Nodes* : random variables     
*Edges* : dependency relation between random variables.     

The generalised formula for CRF is

   ### Sarcasm Detection <a name="sarcasm"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sarcasm Detection module will determine the sarcastic score of a sentence. The Model will output will a value between -100 to 100 which will then be scaled to the range 0 to 1. The sentence is more likely to be sarcastic when the score is larger. This label will be used in the SDQC Module as a feature. For example, if a sentence is labelled as Support to the root tweet but it is actually sarcastic sentence, then the actual label should be Denial since it is sarcastically positive.

The idea in theory is to find a pivot(s) in a sentence and split those sentences and analyse them seperately. Most of the times sarcastic sentences have alternating sentiment polarity such as *"Absolutely adore it | when my bus is late"*.  Some of the sample outputs are :

   ### Veracity Prediction <a name="veracity"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Veracity Prediction module is built using a *Deep Stacked LSTM Neural Network* model to predict whether a tweet is a Rumour or not by capturing the patterns in the tweet related features, user related features and SDQC label predicted in the SDQC module through modelling the conversational structure of tweets. The Dataset used here is RumouEval Dataset provided by SemEval forum.

   ### Substantiation Module <a name="substantiation"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Substantiation Module is created to verify the truthness of a tweet by searching for trusted evidence from the internet. It is implemented by constructing a *Deep Self learning BiLSTM Neural Network* also known as Siamese Network. It is used to capture the sentence similarity using word embeddings implemented using Keras which contains two identical subnetworks, i.e, they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights and the Parameter updating is mirrored across both subnetworks.           
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In real world, Siamese is a word used to describe twins who were born with some part of their bodies joined together. Initially a predicate is created from the tweet. And a Knowledge Graph is created from the content of trusted sources curated by the Siamese Network by capturing the similarity with the tweet. Then the system checks whether the predicate is present in the Knowledge graph or not and also provides the most similar sentences to substantiate the claim.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *In the near future, this work can be extended to identify suspicious profiles on twitter based on the kind of tweets the profile contains. This can be useful in finding terror groups among users. Also, this work can be the basis of an extension or an application that helps identify fake news.*
